## Hi, I am Adam

I enjoy making UI from data, it is kind of my thing.

I am a Senior Web Developer at Brown University in Providence, Rhose Island where I work primarily on the mobile app ([ios](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brownu/id1451512175?ls=1) & [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.brown.modo)) and stating a design system. I also contribute design and some front end work to Project Evergreen's [Greenwood](https://www.greenwoodjs.io/) project. I use [@adam-at-brown](https://github.com/adam-at-brown) for my work stuff, here are my personal repos, project and things I build for friends.

Besides playing with code I am an [artist](https://www.adamholtzman.com/), [photography and painting mostly] curator, former chef and publisher/book designer among other things. I have a [conceptual art project](https://www.breakingsomeeggs.com/) that involves code, video, design, eggs and other nonsense that you are welcome to check out as well.
