## Hi, I am Adam

I am a web developer (React primarily) at Brown University in Providence and contribute design and some front end work to Project Evergreen's [Greenwood](https://www.greenwoodjs.io/) project. I use [@adam-at-brown](https://github.com/adam-at-brown) for my work stuff, here are my personal repos.

Besides playing with code I am an [artist](https://www.adamholtzman.com/) (photography and painting), curator, former chef and publisher/book designer among other things.
